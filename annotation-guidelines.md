The goal of this task is to determine whether a word is a noun or a verb, depending on how it is used. A **noun** is used to name something such as a person, place, thing, quality, or idea. A **verb** is used to describe an action or a state. Many words in English can be both:

| Word       | Used as Noun | Used as Verb |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| book       | The ***book*** is blue. | John will ***book*** a table. |
| play       | The ***play*** has a great review. | The children have gone to ***play***. |
| review     | The play has a great ***review***. | I need to ***review*** my homework. |

You will be provided with a *word*, and asked to determine whether it is being used as a **noun** or a **verb**.

|   | Example | Annotation |
|---|:------- | -----------|
| 1 | The ***book*** was heavy to carry. | Noun |
| 2 | I’d like to ***book*** a table. | Verb |
| 3 | The Gypsy Game by Zilpha Keatley Snyder is a 1997 sequel to the Newbery Honor ***book*** The Egypt Game. | Noun |
| 4 | An old friend of Albert Campion , Uncle William Faraday, has written a successful ***book*** that has been turned into a hit musical comedy . | Noun |
| 5 | Employing a nice bit of alliteration for which all the deputies names were clearly created: ``Bailey, you ***book*** the Bradley boy, Baxter take the bassinet of baby Belials in back and get Brody to come by… | Verb |
| 6 | From technical point of ***view*** radio network has got very fast response time with a minimal jitter. | Noun |
| 7 | Vernon and Liz go to ***view*** a bar, possibly intending to buy it. | Verb |
| 8 | Leibniz thinks, in his ***view***, there are an infinite number of possible worlds. | Noun |
| 9 | Otherwise, one must choose a way to ***view*** each G ( x ) in terms of a single group, and this choice can be arbitrary. | Verb |

### Sample Reasoning
1. *book* is a **noun** because it follows a determiner (“the”).
2. *book* is a **verb** in this sentence because it combines with “to”.  This is very similar to an example verb sentence in the dictionary definition for book: “I have booked a table at the Swan.”
3. *book* is a **noun** since it also has a determiner “the” attached to it.  Substituting in synonyms, “the Newbery Honor volume” sounds much better grammatically than “the Newbery Honor prearrange”.
4. *book* is a **noun** since it is being modified by an adjective, “successful”.  Another indication is that you could follow this sentence with: “The book is good”, putting “the” before “book”.
5. You could not follow this sentence with “The book is good.”  *book* is a **verb** here because you can combine it with auxiliaries: “you *can* book the Bradley boy”, “you *may* book the Bradley boy”.  Replacing with synonyms, “you *reserve* the Bradley boy” sounds much more grammatical than “you notebook the Bradley boy.”
6. For this example, *view* is a **noun** since “technical point of opinion” is much more grammatical than “technical point of consider”.
7. The combination with “to” (“to view”) gives evidence that *view* is a **verb** here.  Substituting synonyms is also useful for this example: “Vernon and Liz go to look at a bar” is much more grammatical than “Vernon and Liz go to opinion a bar”.
8. Again the synonyms are useful for making the correct decision here: “in his opinion” sounds grammatical, while “in his consider” does not.
9. One way to tell that *view* is a **verb** is that you can make it past tense: “choose a way to have viewed” is grammatical.  In contrast, in the earlier examples, it is not grammatical to say “Leibniz thinks, in his viewed, there are an infinite number of possible worlds.”
